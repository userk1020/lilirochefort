        <h1>Lili's Background</h1>
        <p>Lili's father is Henrik Rochefort, a tycoon living in Monaco. They live in a luxurious mansion with their butler, Sebastian. Four years before the events of Tekken 5, when she was 12 years old, Lili was the victim of an attempted kidnapping by her brother. While trying to escape from the kidnappers, she unexpectedly attacked one of the bandits and fought with her brother. At that moment, she realized the pleasure of subduing her opponents and decided to train to be a street fighter. Even though she became a powerful fighter, she is a docile and gentle young woman.</p>
